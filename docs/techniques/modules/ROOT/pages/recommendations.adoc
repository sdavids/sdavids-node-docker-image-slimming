The following should always be done:

* xref:001-dockerignore.adoc[.dockerignore file]
* xref:002-npm-ci.adoc[npm ci]
* xref:004-alpine.adoc[smaller base image]
* xref:005-alpine-multi-stage-build.adoc[multi-stage build]
* xref:006-alpine-alpine-final.adoc[separate serving image]

Cleaning the `node_modules` folder should always be done unless you bundle your sources without external dependencies:

* xref:003-clean-modules.adoc[clean-modules]

Hardening the base image should always be considered, even if it does not significantly lower the image's size:

* xref:007-alpine-hardening.adoc[hardened image]

Compressing the `node` binary is also worthwhile (118.1MB => 41.3MB):

* xref:008-alpine-upx.adoc[UPX compressed Node binary]

Bundling and minifying your source files is a good idea if the decreased debugging experience is acceptable:

* xref:009-alpine-esbuild-external.adoc[bundled JavaScript with external packages]
* xref:010-alpine-esbuild.adoc[bundled JavaScript without external packages]
